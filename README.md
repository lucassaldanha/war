# War #

## Java implementation of War board game ##

### Overview ###

War is a board game inspired by Risk. 

This project was born in November, 2012, when I was taking Software Engineering classes  at Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF).
It was developed by me and another five students. After the semester I decided to continue the development, removing bugs and occasionally adding new features to the game.

The graphical interface is pretty simple and intuitive and almost all rules of the original board game were developed.

### Technical details ###

This game was developed as a Maven project. Also, we used some libraries to help:
- JGraphT (http://jgrapht.org/)
- Slick (http://www.slick2d.org/)
- Nifty (http://nifty-gui.lessvoid.com/)
- and others... Plese check the project's POM for a full list of required libraries.

### Changelog ###
#### 1.0.0-BETA (2013/03/14) #####
- Beta release of the game.
